## Props an State

### Author: Siobhan Niess

### Modules
#### `index.js`
#### `app.js`
#### `form.js`

### How it is all connected
The index.js file hold the main class and imports the app.js file in. The app.js file holds the work from the form. Then the form.js holds all of the work that the form does. The app.js imports in the form.js and the work that it does for the app.js to do what it needs to so that the form works properly.
